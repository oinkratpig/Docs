# Terminology

## Dash
It's very confusing that one of her powers is called Chase considering chasing is a major mechanic in the game. I will be referring to it at "Dash" in this guide to avoid confusion.
## Snug
The name of Houndmaster's hound.

# Outside of Chase

## Search

Search is very, very helpful for map movement - but there's a huge mistake many Houndmaster's make. You DO NOT want to send Snug to generators.

Sending Snug to a generator will result in a ridiculously long trek. If at any point you see something interesting and want to divert from the Search path, Snug will still remain on that path and be unavailable for a significant time.

Instead, send Snug out repeatedly for short distances. Since there is virtually no cooldown for Search, you are not punished whatsoever for spamming it. Use it to walk multiple short distances.

## Dash

Dash is, ironically, is a better method of searching than Search. While redirecting, any survivors nearby will be highlighted with Killer Instinct INCLUDING survivors in lockers.

If you think there may be survivors nearby, send out a Dash and then immediately redirect. Look for Killer Instincts and then cancel the Dash.

### Diversions

Chasing within loops as Houndmaster is quite difficult, but you have one huge, underrated strength - diverting attention. The human brain can only focus on one thing at once, and there happen to be two aggressors that survivors need to worry about.

Sending out Snug will cause it to immediately occupy the survivor's mind. They may remember your location, but attention will be on Snug rather than you. You can use this to your advantage and and intentionally avoid redirection to cause confusion. In the survivor's mind, they're expecting a redirect - they will not be focused on you gaining distance.
### Flicking

Unfortunately, Snug is really easy to dodge. It takes less than a second to duck behind cover when they see a redirect coming. It is highly advised to plan ahead of time the angle your redirect will take, and then redirect -> flick -> send IMMEDIATELY. There should be minimal time between taking control of a redirect and sending it out to lower the chances of survivors reacting to it.

Obviously, if there is no cover near the survivor, you are free to take your time. But if the survivor's smart, they will always be near cover in case you Dash.
### Faking at Loops

If you play every loop expecting to get a hit with Dash, the survivors will simply just dodge every attack. This is the most common-sense thing to do when playing Houndmaster, and survivors are aware of this.

Most Houndmasters will aim around loops as pictured, with the goal to land a hit with a redirect. This is, however, very predictable and easy to dodge. Instead, send out a single Dash but do not redirect. The survivor will predict a redirect and attempt to dodge, but it will never come. They will lose significant distance, allowing you to catch up. If you want to be particularly convincing, start a redirect but immediately cancel it. Survivors will see that you have possessed the dog to redirect and almost certainly make a dodging attempt, even if they are smart.

### Survivor Positioning

If the survivor is smart, after Dash is used they will always run to their perceived safest place to stand. This is often as far away from Snug, with as many obstacles between them and Snug as possible.

One example of survivor positioning:
![](https://i.imgur.com/HrqKJHS.png)

In this image, the killer is on the edge of a wall and last saw a survivor running past a pallet along the side of the aisles. Since there's a window in the middle, it may be tempting to send a Dash so that a redirect can attack along the entire aisle. This would be true for a normal M1 killer, as the window aisle would be the safest area - but once you send out Snug, the survivor will immediately see that aisle as dangerous. They will likely run out of the aisle and out to the back wall. Instead, it's recommended to send out Snug to the very back side of the aisle. They, standing in the window aisle, will assume you're going to send Snug in the aisle they were standing in, and run outside to safety - but that's actually where you sent it.
## Search

Search unfortunately disables in chase, but that doesn't mean it's useless. If you're at a large tile and chase has not started yet, you can use Search to increase your movement speed along the tile. Just avoid triggering the chase until you've caught up.
# Playing Around Bugs
---
Houndmaster is very, very buggy. But some of the bugs are able to be played around.
## Returning from Search

Sometimes when returning from a Search, Snug will stay _right_ behind you - just far enough away that the cooldown won't begin. To fix this, there are two possible solutions:
- Let go of forward movement for any amount of time. Snug will catch up immediately.
	- **Pro(s):** Fastest way for Snug to catch up (cooldown begins faster).
	- **Con(s):** Decent amount of distance lost.
	- **Conclusion:** Use if you need the cooldown back ASAP.
- Strafe side-to-side while moving forward. You will lose slight distance, allowing Snug to catch up.
	- **Pro(s):** Minimal distance lost.
	- **Con(s):** Might take a bit longer for Snug to catch up.
	- **Conclusion:** Use if you don't care about the cooldown refreshing immediately.

# Perks
---
Houndmaster is very good in some situations and completely unusable in others. Having perks that mitigate her massive weaknesses are essential. Here is her "shopping list":
- She needs gen regression (like every other killer).
- She needs help working around "impossible" tiles.
## Ideal Build

Covers "impossible" tiles and both types of problem maps: large and multi-story.

- **Brutal Strength**
- **Superior Anatomy**
- **Surge**
- **Scourge Hook: Pain Resonance**
## Tiers
Tiers are defined as the following:
- **S Tier:** Meta (recommended for optimal build).
- **A Tier:** Great substitutes for meta - not as good as S Tier, but close.
- **B Tier:** Good, but outclassed by other options.
- **C Tier:** Usable but not recommended if goal is to win.
- **D Tier:** Recommended against using.
- **F Tier:** Highly recommended against using.
## S Tier
- **Bamboozle** / **Superior Anatomy**
	- There are many tiles where Dash cannot be used effectively due to vaults. Helps counter those tiles.
- **Brutal Strength**
	- There are many maps in which predropping and pallet camping absolutely destroys her. This helps alleviate the issue.
	- There are many tiles that Dash cannot be used effectively in any way. Helps chew threw pallets faster.
	- Catching up quickly means the survivor is more vulnerable to Dash before making it to a loop.
- **Scourge Hook: Pain Resonance**
	- Large maps can be very, very painful. Helps pressure gens that are far from the player that you otherwise wouldn't be able to reach in time.
- **Surge**
	- Extremely helpful on multi-story maps, which she struggles on heavily due to bugs.
	- All hits can proc Surge because Houndmaster only uses basic attacks.
## A Tier
- **Dead Man's Switch**
	- Great in general due to the absurd amount of blocking time.
	- Works well with Surge.
- **Oppression**
	- Large maps can be very, very painful. Helps pressure gens that are far from the player that you otherwise wouldn't be able to reach in time.
	- Does not trigger gen regression events on far gens, which is great.
